        Strife EU originally started as an xbox clan called GMT Roughneck which was founded shortly after the release of Destiny back in 2014. When Destiny 2 released in 2017, a PC section was made for the clan, however this grew quickly and eventually had to separate from the old Xbox clan. Defwhish split off the PC section to form this clan, Strife EU.

        Even though we split from the Xbox clan, friendships have remained. There have been clan bbqs, nights out at conventions such as EGX and more. We also hold in house events.

        We are much more than just a clan, we are a community with a focus on friendships and having a laugh.
