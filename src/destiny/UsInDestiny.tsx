      <h2>Us in Destiny 2</h2>
      <p>
        Destiny 2 is our main game in the server. We are an all around clan with a focus on endgame content, which includes both PvE and PvP. We set up multiple raids per week and heavily encourage setting up any activities you want to see run yourself, with guides to use the bot in server.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of setting up activities for in game, we host in house events such as crucible tournaments and speedrun races. While some of these are created by the admin team, we highly encourage memebers to set up events or give ideas to the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our discord is also a place of information. It's where we can talk about and get excited for new content coming, ask about old content or weapon rolls and much more!
